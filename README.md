### The name's brad, but d4rb is fine too

**he/him, any pronouns are OK**

Undergrad music producer and hardware technician from Texas.

In terms of software engineering skills I dabble in website design (HTML/CSS), with an amateur understanding of Lua, Python and Visual Basic. Looking to branch out into C++ and C# at some point.

For contact purposes, you may reach out to me at d4rblabs@gmail.com, or on Discord at ***d4rb#7514***.
