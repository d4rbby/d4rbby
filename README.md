### I'm brad

**any pronouns OK, he/they preferred**

Hardware technician from Texas.

In terms of software engineering skills I dabble in website design (HTML/CSS), with an amateur understanding of Lua, Python and Visual Basic. Looking to branch out into C++ and C# at some point.

For contact purposes, you may reach out to me at d4rblabs@gmail.com.
